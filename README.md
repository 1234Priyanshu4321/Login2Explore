# Project Title: Employee Management System with JsonPowerDB

## Description

This project is an **Employee Management System** that leverages the power of **JsonPowerDB (JPDB)**. It is a simple yet efficient system that allows CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on employee data. The application is built using HTML, Bootstrap for UI, and JQuery for backend interactions with JsonPowerDB. JPDB is used as the database for fast data storage and retrieval.

JsonPowerDB is a high-performance, serverless, and real-time NoSQL database that allows easy data handling using JSON documents. This project demonstrates how JPDB can be integrated seamlessly with web applications.

## Benefits of using JsonPowerDB

- **Efficient NoSQL Database**: JPDB uses a JSON-based NoSQL architecture which simplifies the data structure, making it easier to work with.
- **Real-time CRUD Operations**: Execute CRUD operations without worrying about database management and complex queries.
- **Serverless Architecture**: No need to manage the database infrastructure. JPDB handles all backend tasks.
- **Low Latency**: JPDB is designed for fast data access and low-latency operations, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Easy Integration**: No complicated setups required. JPDB integrates seamlessly with front-end applications using simple API calls.
